                Plane Safety Protocols
            </h1>
            <img src="plane1.jpg" id="plane1">
            <h2>
                So we will be talking about some safety protocols airline providers have implemented in their airplanes
            </h2>
            <h3>
                So let's start with some emergency landing protocols, one general rule of thumb here is that all passengers should remain calm throughout the entire evacuation
            </h3>

                DITCHING
            </b>
            <img src="plane water landing.jpg" id="plane2">
            <h3>
                Now the first type of evacuation we will talk about is ditching, which also means a water landing, so a water landing is when a plane has to take an emergency landing in a body of water. Some of the main reasons a plane would have to do a water landing are because either the engine failed or the fuel in the plane is running out or is already empty
            </h3>
            <h3>
                In a water landing the first thing the crew does is they inform the passengers of there plans and then they proceed to land the plane in the water. The way they land the plane in the water is that the dip the tail of the plane first in to the water because that will slow the plane down enough for them to have a soft landing, if they don't do that they risk having super rough and dangerous landing, which could cause the plane to go pretty deep in the water once it lands. 
            </h3>
            <h3>
                once the aircraft lands in the water the crew on the aircraft will send a MAYDAY signal to all near airports for, after they will deploy the safety slides, once the slides are deployed the crew will will turn the slides into rafts by detatching the slides from the aircraft, once all that is done they will instruct the passengers to inflate there life-vests and jump into the water through their emergency exit. After they jump into the water, the crew will help the passenger onto the raft.

                CRASH LANDING EVACUATION
            </b>
            <img src="plane crash.jpg" id="plane3">
            <h3>
                Now we will be talking about crash landings and their evacuations, so first let's start with what could cause a crash landing. their are many factors to a crash landing, here are just a few possibilties that could lead to a plane to crash: pilot error, sabotage, intentional crashes, miscommunication with ATC(Air Traffic Control) or an error caused by ATC, groundworker error and weather.  
            </h3>
            <h3>
                So now we are done talking about the possibilties, let's start with the actual evacuation so agian the first thing the crew will do is tell the passengers that the plane is going to be crash landing, but before they do that they will send a message to ATC and also send a MAYDAY signal to all near airports for support after the landing, then the pilots will try to make the decent as safely as possible. Most of the a pilot will try to stall as long as possible if they are in a area with uneven or generally hard to land in terrain like if they are above trees or hills, once a pilot finds nice and even ground they will try to make a landing. 
            </h3>
            <h3>
                But if the plane is over bumpy terrain and they are losing altitude quickly the pilot will have to make due with what terrain they have, meaning they will have to try to make a safe landing no matter what terrain 
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Now once the plane gets on the ground, all passengers are told to leave through their set emergency exit door and after all the passengers are out the proccess varies either on what the situation is, what the pilot thinks to do or what ATC tells them to do.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                But if the plane is elavated by a tree or any other object, it is recommended to stay in the plane and wait for help. But if the situation call for everyone to get out of the plane, most of the time they if they are not very suspended of the ground, everyone could try to jump of the plane or they could attempt to climb down whatever is suspending them in the air.
            </h3>

                ONBOARD FIRE
            </b>
            <img src="onborad fire.jpg" id="plane4">
            <h3>
                Their isn't much to talk about when talking about onboard fires, most the time either the plane will have a fire extinguisher and the crew will deal with the fire with that, or incase it is a big fire, to big for a fire extinguisher, the plane would have to make an emergency landing in the nearest airport and call the fire department.
            </h3>
            <b id="make_this_bold4">
                OTHER EMERGENCIES
            </b>
            <h3>
                So you might be thinking of some other kind of emergency we didn't talk about, so now we will try to cover some of those, if we didn't cover yours, please don't be afraid to ask. now our first one will be if one plane engine fails, so most planes do have a second engine onboard that the pilot will activate if the first does fail, but if there is only one engine on the plane, the plain will have to either make and emergency landing where ever the plane is or if possible the plane will make an emergency landing at the closest airport. another emergency you could be thinking about is what if another plane crashed into your plane, that is incredibly rare, the likely hood of a regular crash landing is already 1 out of 1.2 million. But if this where to happen both of the plane would make a crash landing on the ground, there wouldn't really be a evacuation because most likely or almost certainly everyone is dead. but if there where survivors they would have to carry out a normal crash landing evcuation.
